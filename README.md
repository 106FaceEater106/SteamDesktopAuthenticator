# Steam Desktop Authenticator
A desktop implementation of Steam's mobile authenticator app.

**Be warned! Using this desktop app in place of Steam's mobile app defeats the entire purpose of another device acting as your authenticator. You assume all responsiblity for keeping your computer secure. If a 3rd party gains access to your  authenticator data they will gain full instant access to your Steam account and all its items!**

## Features:
- Generate login codes and confirm trades on multiple Steam accounts with ease.
- Enable Steam's mobile auth on new accounts.

## Coming soon:
- Encryption. Enter your password to decrypt your data and generate codes / perform confirmations. Protects against files being stolen. Does not protect against keyloggers.
- Notifications when you have a trade waiting to be confirmed.
- Import config file from a rooted Android device so you don't have to remove and re-add the desktop authenticator.
